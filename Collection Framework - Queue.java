/*
A Queue is designed in such a way so that the elements added to it are placed at the end of Queue and removed from the beginning of Queue. The concept here is similar to the queue we see in our daily life, for example, when a new iPhone launches we stand in a queue outside the apple store, whoever is added to the queue has to stand at the end of it and persons are served on the basis of FIFO (First In First Out), The one who gets the iPhone is removed from the beginning of the queue.

Queue interface in Java collections has two implementation: LinkedList and PriorityQueue, these two classes implements Queue interface.
Queue is an interface so we cannot instantiate it, rather we create instance of LinkedList or PriorityQueue and assign it to the Queue like this:

import java.util.*;
public class QueueExample1 {
	 
   public static void main(String[] args) {
	  
      /*
       * We cannot create instance of a Queue as it is an
       * interface, we can create instance of LinkedList or
       * PriorityQueue and assign it to Queue
       */
      Queue<String> q = new LinkedList<String>();
	    
      //Adding elements to the Queue
      q.add("Rick");
      q.add("Maggie"); 
      q.add("Glenn");
      q.add("Negan");
      q.add("Daryl");
	    
      System.out.println("Elements in Queue:"+q);

      /*
       * We can remove element from Queue using remove() method,
       * this would remove the first element from the Queue 
       */
      System.out.println("Removed element: "+q.remove());
	    
      /*
       * element() method - this returns the head of the
       * Queue. Head is the first element of Queue
       */
      System.out.println("Head: "+q.element());
	    
      /*
       * poll() method - this removes and returns the 
       * head of the Queue. Returns null if the Queue is empty
       */
      System.out.println("poll(): "+q.poll());
	    
      /*
       * peek() method - it works same as element() method,
       * however it returns null if the Queue is empty
       */
      System.out.println("peek(): "+q.peek());
	    
      //Again displaying the elements of Queue
      System.out.println("Elements in Queue:"+q);
   }
